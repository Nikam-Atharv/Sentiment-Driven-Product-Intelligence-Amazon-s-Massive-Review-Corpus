Description:
🚀 Excited to share my latest project on Natural Language Processing (NLP)! In this endeavor, I delved into the world of sentiment analysis using Python and various NLP libraries.

📊 Project Overview:
I harnessed the power of NLP to analyze sentiment in Amazon product reviews, specifically focusing on the Software category. The project involves data preprocessing, HTML parsing, and text cleaning techniques to prepare the reviews for analysis.

🛠️ Key Steps:

Loaded a vast dataset of Amazon product reviews using Python.
Employed NLTK and SpaCy libraries for text processing, including removing punctuation, newline characters, and stop words.
Utilized sentiment analysis libraries (such as VADER) to assign polarity scores to each review.
Implemented a custom sentiment analysis function using the SentiWordNet lexicon.
Developed a SpaCy extension to calculate sentiment scores within the NLP pipeline.
💡 Highlights:

Explored sentiment analysis on a subset of reviews for faster processing.
Demonstrated the application of both traditional and modern NLP approaches.
Shared insights into the sentiment distribution among the analyzed reviews.
📈 Results:
Highlighted a few reviews with sentiment scores, providing a glimpse into the positive, neutral, and negative sentiments expressed by users.
